1 what is angular 16 ?
 - it is front end Freamwork
 - Angular (google) , React js(facebook ), embber js,vue js , JSP 
 - gmail,github,sbi mutual funds,ganna.com,walmart 

2 Why Angular?/ advantage of Angular ?/ explain the features of angular?
- Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
- Angular have module ,declarative templates, dependency injection, services ,end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. 

- Angular build applications that live on the web, mobile,or the desktop.

- Angular has matured into a client-side MVW framework  (i.e. Model-View-Whatever) for building of complex single page Application.

- It places equal importance on application testing & application writing, while simplifying the development process.

- Angular has tag line One framework Mobile & desktop,web.

- It support Cross platform Progressive web apps (i.e. It support all platform mobile,desktop,different os)

- It famous also for his speed & performance (bcz it is optimized for today's javascript virtual machine)

- It is universal framework (i.e. node.js with express js,.net,php,java & other servers for near-instants server side language)

- It has code splitting
	- It has in build router system to load quickly
	- Users only load code required to render the view on that request.
	
- You can create Quick UI views with simple & powerful template syntax.

- Angular is in build CLI(Command Line Interface) Tool,so you fast building,add components & tests it.

- Two way data binding Supports => if u want to add/update/render dynamically. 


index.html
<html>
	<head></head>
	<body><body>
</html>


3 SPA - Single Page Application
It contain only 1head+1 body
SPA environment in the browser â€” no page reloads, no extra wait time.
Angular These are, many E.g:

4 what is Typescript?
- Typescript is Object Orientated Lang.
- Typescript is superset of javascript
- Developed By Mircosoft 2012
- It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft
its coding style is used like C++
- The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language
- ECMAScript standard + ECMAScript version6(JS) + Additional features(Opps Concept,module)=Typescript


5 Advantages
1 Strong static typing
       - TypeScript is a typed language, where we can specify the type of the variables, function parameters and object properties
inferred Type to mention Data type of Variable, if not mentioned Data type its by deafault take "any" Data type
2 Find Compile Time Error 
3 Supports 
  - Classess
  - Inheritance
  - interface
  - enum
  - Function Override

Disadvantage
- Browser Don't understand Typescript
	.ts +tsc (typescript compiler)=>.js (javascript)
	
- Generally TypeScript takes time to compile the code.

2 Component Creation
	1 manually Creation 
	2 Command line => CLI 
		ng g c componetName
3 Bootstrap Integration 
	- It is Css Framwork
	- In build css Classes 
	- To make Application Attractive

		@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
4 Data binding 
	What is Data Binding
		- we can update behaviour of data dynamically 
		- Data flow from view to component & vice versa.
		1 one way data binding
			- data flow from component(ts) to view(html) 
			1 string interpolation 
				- to display/render data dynamically 
			2 property binding
			3 style binding
			4 class binding
			
		2 Two way data binding
5 String Interpolation
